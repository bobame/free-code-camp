## Specifications

- see [CodePen](http://codepen.io/gracen/full/ygrdaG/) for completed version

**Instructions:**

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer <4digits>>
```

---

### Objective:
Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/eZGMjp).

**User Stories:**  

1. [X] I can see a table of the Free Code Camp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
2. [X] I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.
3. [X] I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.
4. [X] Must use Sass and React.
5. [ ] Get it working on codepen so that you can finally submit this sucker =)

**Hints:**

1. [X] To get the top 100 campers for the last 30 days: https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/recent.
2. [X] To get the top 100 campers of all time: https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/alltime.
