## Notes

**Title:** First Lady, Activist, Champion of Human Rights, Astounding Role Model for All

**Image:** Eleanor Roosevelt holding a poster of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

**Quote:**

> One's philosophy is not best expressed in words; it is expressed in the choices one makes... and the choices we make are ultimately our responsibility.

> Freedom makes a huge requirement of every human being. With freedom comes responsibility. For the person who is unwilling to grow up, the person who does not want to carry his own weight, this is a frightening prospect.
