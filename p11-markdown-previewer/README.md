## Specifications

- see [CodePen](#) for completed version **UPDATE LINK**

### Objective:
Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/JXrLLE).


**User Stories:**  

1. [] I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.
2. [] I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.
3. [] Must use Sass.
4. [] Must use React.

**Hints:**

1. [] You don't need to interpret Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked
2. [] If you want to use the React JSX syntax, you need to enable 'Babel' as a preprocessor
