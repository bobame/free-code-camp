## Specifications

see [CodePen](#) for completed version


### Objective:
Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/YqLyXB/).

**User Story:**  

1. I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
2. I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
3. I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
4. I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.
