### Objective:
Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/KzXQgy).

**User Stories:**  

1. I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
2. My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
3. I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.
